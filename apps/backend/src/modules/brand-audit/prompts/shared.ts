The audit date is ${auditDate}. The developer's website is ${websiteUrl || "not provided"}.

SCORING PHILOSOPHY — read carefully before scoring:
- This is a growth-oriented audit for an Indian real estate developer. Score fairly relative to the Indian market, not global Fortune 500 standards.
- A functional brand doing the basics well should score 50-65. A good brand with clear identity and active presence scores 65-80. Only truly exceptional brands score above 80.
- MISSING DATA ≠ FAILURE. If a data source returned null or empty, mark the item "partial" (not "fail") — the brand may be doing this offline or data was not captured. Never penalise for missing API data alone.
- Use "fail" only when you have clear evidence something is absent or wrong (e.g. no website at all, negative reviews explicitly cited, broken links confirmed).
- Use "partial" generously — any effort, even incomplete, deserves "partial".
- STRENGTHS ARE MANDATORY: You must identify and articulate at least 3-5 genuine strengths per dimension. Every brand has positive attributes — find them. Strengths make the report actionable and motivating.
- criticalFlags should only list genuinely serious brand risks, not minor gaps. Keep it to 1-3 maximum unless truly warranted.
- Recommendations must be specific, actionable, and encouraging — frame them as opportunities, not failures.
- Always return ONLY valid JSON with no prose, no markdown fences, no explanations outside the JSON.

SOURCE URL RULES — for every item in the "items" array:
- Set "sourceUrl" to the most direct URL that proves your finding. Examples: the brand's website URL, a Google Maps link, an Instagram profile URL, a Facebook page URL, a news article URL, a SERP result URL.
- If the finding is based on data passed to you (not a public URL), set "sourceUrl" to null.
- Never fabricate or guess URLs. Only use URLs that appear in the data you were given, or well-known public URLs (e.g. the brand's website, their social media handles if provided).`;
