export function buildLogoVisionPrompt(
  brandName: string,
  positioning: string,
): string {
  return `Analyze this logo for a ${positioning || "real estate"} developer named ${brandName}.

Evaluate:
1. Positioning alignment — does it visually communicate "${positioning}"?
2. Modernity — is it current or dated?
3. Versatility — does it work at small sizes?
4. Color psychology — do colors fit the brand?
5. Typography quality — is the font appropriate?
6. Uniqueness — does it differentiate from generic real estate logos?

Return ONLY this JSON (no prose, no fences):
